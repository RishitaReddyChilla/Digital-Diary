### Digital-Diary
Internet and web programming project

Our project is a web application which provides users to maintain a digital diary. Since users would like to ensure their privacy for what they write here, appropriate functions are used to protect their data. The project outcome is to present a more functional and efficient way to maintain their diaries than the traditional paper diaries. It will offer a range of advantages compared to the paper version of diaries.
